          The top attraction in Arizona is the Grand Canyon National Park, the
          only Wonder of the World located in the U.S. Spanning 1,904 square
          miles, the canyon is over a mile deep and ten miles wide. Of the more
          than 6 million visitors the park receives each year, fewer than 5%
          venture below the rim. Of those, only about 40,000 people stay in the
          canyon longer than a day hike. The temperature from the rim to the
          base of the canyon can vary by as much as 27 degrees. At the canyon's
          base lies Supai Village, a town inaccessible by road and the only
          place in the U.S. where mail is still delivered by pack mule.

          If visiting the Grand Canyon isn't an option, Horseshoe Bend offers a
          stunning alternative. Here, you can witness towering canyon walls and
          a dramatic curve of the Colorado River, forming a horseshoe-like
          shape. Located near Page, Arizona, it's easily accessible by a short
          hike from a nearby parking area. The overlook provides breathtaking
          views, especially at sunrise and sunset, making it a must-see
          destination for photographers and nature lovers alike.

          The Desert Botanical Garden spans 140 acres, with 55 acres dedicated
          to cultivated plants and over 50,000 individual displays, including
          544 rare and endangered species. The best time to visit is between
          February and May, during the vibrant wildflower season.

          Antelope Canyon is divided into two sections: Upper and Lower Antelope
          Canyon. It is a "slot canyon" formed over millions of years by the
          erosion of sedimentary rock through flash flooding and wind. In 1997,
          it became an official Navajo Tribal Park, as the canyon holds deep
          cultural and spiritual significance to the Navajo people.

        <span>Did you know?</span>
        <p>A Sonoran hot dog is a unique and flavorful twist on the traditional hot dog, originating from the Sonoran region of Mexico and popular in Arizona. It starts with a bacon-wrapped beef hot dog, grilled to perfection and served in a soft, slightly sweet bolillo-style bun. The toppings are what set it apart: it's typically loaded with pinto beans, diced tomatoes, onions, jalape√±os, and fresh cilantro. It's often garnished with mustard, mayo, and a drizzle of spicy salsa or hot sauce, creating a delicious combination of smoky, savory, and spicy flavors in every bite.</p>
