          Preserve, which spans 16,000 acres, and the Desert Botanical Garden,
          which contains one of the largest collections of desert plants. The
          population of Phoenix has dramatically increased in recent years; it
          is now ranked the 7th most popular city for relocation, with a
          population of 1,608,139 according to the most recent census. The city

        The city is also known for its sunshine, boasting 300 days of sun each

      <p>
        Pinetop-Lakeside defies the common myth that Arizona is only desert and
        cactus. Home to 3 million acres of forests, meadows, mesas, lakes,
        streams, and brushland, it is truly a scenic wonder. Incorporated in
        1984, the town has a population of 4,557 and is located on Arizona's
        eastern border, offering a mix of suburban and rural living. Despite its
        small population, the area is home to over 400 species of wildlife.
        However, it also hosts dangerous animals such as bears, wolves, and
        mountain lions. Additionally, there are over 200 miles of developed
        multi-use trails, ideal for hiking, biking, and horseback riding.
